1.
Simple, remove the spaces from the string, then return the resultant string.

String noSpace(String x) {
  return x.replaceAll(' ','');
}


2.
Summation
Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

For example:

summation(2) -> 3
1 + 2

summation(8) -> 36
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8


This one i tried a lot of diferent option trying to not use the for but i didnt found an option to make this work
only with the for was possible

int summation(int n) {
  // your code here

    var sum = 0;
    for(var i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        sum += i;
    }
    return sum;
}


Today i had a lot of struggles with my project so i upload this two practices that i made
